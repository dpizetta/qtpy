"""
**QtPy** is a shim over the various Python Qt bindings. It is used to
write Qt binding independent libraries or applications.

If one of the APIs has already been imported, then it will be used.

Otherwise, the shim will automatically select the first available API
following the list below; in that case, you can force the use of one
specific binding (e.g. if your application is using one specific binding
and you need to use a library that uses QtPy) by setting up the
``QT_API`` environment variable.

For each selected binding, there will be more three attempts if it is
not found, following the most recent (Qt5) and most stable (PyQt) API.
See below:

* pyqt5: PyQt5, PySide2, PyQt4, PySide
* pyside2: PySide2, PyQt5, PyQt4, PySide
* pyqt4: PyQt4, PySide, PyQt5, PySide2
* pyside: PySide, PyQt4, PyQt5, PySide2

The clearest way to set which API is to be used by QtPy is setting
``QT_API`` environment variable. The default value for ``QT_API = 'pyqt5'``
(not case sensitive).

The priority when setting the Qt binding API is detailed below:

1 Have been already imported any Qt binding (not recommended, implicit):
    1.1 QT_API is not set, pass, no output;
    1.2 QT_API is set to the same binding, pass, no output;
    1.3 QT_API is set to a different binding, ignore QT_API, pass but warns;

2 Have NOT been already imported any Qt binding (explicitly setting):
    2.1 QT_API is set correctly, pass;
        2.1.1 If binding is found, pass, no output;
        2.1.2 If binding is not found, try another one (more three);
            2.1.2.a If any is found (different from set), pass but warns;
            2.1.2.b If no one is found, stop, error;
    2.2 QT_API is not set correctly, stop, error;

Note 1: if any Qt binding is imported (a different one) after QtPy
import, issues and errors may occur and QtPy won't be able to help you
with any warning.

Note 2: we always preffer to not break the code when something is not
found, so we use ``warnings`` module to alert changes and show information
that may be useful when developing using QtPy. Remember to set warnings
to show messages.

PyQt5
=====

For PyQt5, you don't have to set anything as it will be used automatically::

    >>> from qtpy import QtGui, QtWidgets, QtCore
    >>> print(QtWidgets.QWidget)

PySide2
=======

Set the QT_API environment variable to 'PySide2' before importing other
packages::

    >>> import os
    >>> os.environ['QT_API'] = 'PySide2'
    >>> from qtpy import QtGui, QtWidgets, QtCore
    >>> print(QtWidgets.QWidget)

PyQt4
=====

Set the ``QT_API`` environment variable to 'PyQt4' before importing any python
package::

    >>> import os
    >>> os.environ['QT_API'] = 'PyQt4'
    >>> from qtpy import QtGui, QtWidgets, QtCore
    >>> print(QtWidgets.QWidget)

PySide
======

Set the QT_API environment variable to 'PySide' before importing other
packages::

    >>> import os
    >>> os.environ['QT_API'] = 'PySide'
    >>> from qtpy import QtGui, QtWidgets, QtCore
    >>> print(QtWidgets.QWidget)
